# Create & edit a collage of floating images

Upload images from your drive &mdash; and float them around your browser window! Distraction-free fullscreen mode lets you:

* Get Help</span> &mdash; Tap the 'H' key
* Pause/resume float action:
  * all images at once &rarr; spacebar
  * each individual image &rarr; click the image
* Drag-n-drop images around the display &rarr; ctrl+ click-n-drag image
* Edit image properties
  * size
  * Display order (to set how images float over/ under each other)
  * transparency
  * => See in-app *__Help tab: How to edit__* for details
